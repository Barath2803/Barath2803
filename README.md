# 👋 Hello! I'm Barath S.

## 🌟 Passionate AI/ML Enthusiast 🌟

### 🚀 Background:
I recently completed my post-graduation in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning from Coimbatore Institute of Technology (5-year integrated degree). With a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and statistical modeling, I am currently working as a Data Scientist, engaging in various exciting projects in the e-commerce domain.

### 📚 Academic Journey:
Throughout my academic journey, I have gained expertise in various ML algorithms, neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision. I thrive on exploring innovative solutions and leveraging data-driven insights to optimize processes, enhance decision-making, and drive business growth.

### 🔬 Personal Projects:

- 🎙️ **Text-to-Speech Model with Six Emotions**
  - Developed a TTS model to generate speech with six emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral.
  - Collected and labeled a dataset of over 1200 sentences manually.
  - Classified short story sentences into six emotions using BERT and Logistic Regression.
  - Converted text to speech with emotion using deep fake audio, achieving a higher accuracy of 65.7%.

- 🖼️ **Image Caption Generator**
  - Created a system to describe images using their objects.
  - Utilized the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction on the Flickr 30k dataset.
  - Employed LSTM to generate captions, achieving an accuracy of 95.7%.

- 🌡️ **Meta-Learning for Temperature Forecasting**
  - Designed a statistical model to forecast temperature and optimized hyperparameters using meta-heuristic algorithms.
  - Employed ARIMA for time series forecasting with a large dataset of 1 lakh+ records.
  - Optimized ARIMA hyperparameters using PSO, GA, and a hybrid PSO-GA algorithm, with the hybrid approach achieving the best accuracy.

- 📚 **Tkinter Library Management System**
  - Developed a user-friendly library management system using Python and MySQL.
  - Implemented functionalities such as adding, deleting, issuing, and returning books through student and faculty portals.

### 💼 Professional Experience:
